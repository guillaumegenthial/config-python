# Tools and techniques for configurable python code

See the [blog post](https://guillaumegenthial.github.io/config-python-techniques.html).

We take a dummy example (a `Model` made of `Layers`, each layer using the same `Vocab`), and cover different ways of configuring pipelines

- [with python](./with-python)
- [with-json](./with-json)
- [with-assembler](./with-assembler)
- [with-gin](./with-gin)

## Install

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

Each of the examples contains a detailed `README` as well as a `run.py` script.
